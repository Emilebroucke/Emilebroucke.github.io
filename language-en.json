    "about": "\n\n\n\n CONTEXT is a <strong>3D studio</strong>, founded by myself, Emile, 27.\n\n  <strong>Architect</strong> by degree <font size=1><em>(Sint-Lucas / UA)</em> </font>, (digital) <strong>artist</strong> by birth <font size=1><em>(Waregem)</em></font>.    \n \n After graduating, started working at <font size=2><em>Infunctievan</em></font> and <font size=2><em>Pixelminds</em></font>. Loved it, obsessively. \n \n Forward a couple of years. <strong>Evolved</strong> from a junior artist to senior. \n \n Started <strong>freelancing</strong>, got a couple of trusty clients. Developed a vision and a pipeline, turned full-time <strong>professional</strong> freelance. Meet <strong>CONTEXT</strong>.\n \n I love <strong>edgy</strong> projects and people. \n  \n If you like my work and want to have a chat, <strong>just hit me up</strong> anywhere anytime. \n\nI render <strong>GPU</strong>.  \n\n\n<font size=1><em>Emile Broucke \n Founder / Architect / Digital Artist </em> </font>",
    "workflow": "\n \n All imagery is done in-house.\n  \nCONTEXT does not work with a specific set of revision rounds. Some projects just need more iterations than others. \n   \n Instead of outdated CPU rendering, CONTEXT may just be one of the first GPU based rendering firms, focusing on  architecture. This  means  faster results  and  more  room  for  adjustments. \n \nInstead of CUDA GPU rendering, CONTEXT uses state of the art RTX technology. Meaning  we  are  on the verge of full real-time rendering.     \n  \nInstead of generic sRGB color space, CONTEXT uses ACEScg, developed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Resulting in a wider and more realistic color spectrum. \n  \nCONTEXT develops all models using Autocad, 3dsmax, and renders in Vray. This so we can import close to every format used by todays architecture firms. ",
