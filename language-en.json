    "workflow": "\n \n \n \n All imagery is done <strong>in-house</strong>.\n \n  Rendering on the <strong>GPU</strong>. This means <strong>faster</strong> results and more room for <strong>adjustments</strong>.  \n \n<strong>CNTXT</strong> does not work with a specific set of revision rounds. Some projects just need more iterations than others. \n \n Incorporating clients in our process is of paramount importance. The more feedback you provide, the better we can fit your needs. \n \n <strong>CNTXT</strong> develops all models using Autocad, 3dsmax, and renders in Vray. This to ensure that almost every format (dwg / skp / fbx / rvt / ifc / 3ds / ...) used by todays architecure firms can be easily implemented. \n \n <strong>Rendering</strong> is such a powerful <strong>design tool</strong>, CNTXT loves being incorporated in the <strong>creative process</strong> as early as possible.
