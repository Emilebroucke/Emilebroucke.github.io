    "about": "\n\n\n\n CONTEXT is a <strong>3D studio</strong>, founded by myself, Emile, 27.\n\n  Architect by degree (Sint-Lucas / UA), (digital) artist by birth.    \n \n Immediately after graduating started working at Infunctievan and Pixelminds. Loved it, obsessively. \n \n Forward a couple of years. Add some freelance experience. Insert corona. Coded myself a website. Meet CONTEXT.\n \n I love, and, encourage it when clients involve me in a early stage of their design process. It is my believe that we should start embracing 3D visualization not only as a marketing tool, but as a high end design tool. I also love edgy projects. \n  \n If you like my work and want to have a chat, <strong>just hit me up</strong> anywhere anytime. \n\nI render <strong>GPU</strong>.  \n\n\n<font size=1><em>Emile Broucke \n Founder / Architect / Digital Artist </em> </font>",
    "workflow": "\n \n All imagery is done in-house.\n  \nCONTEXT does not work with a specific set of revision rounds. Some projects just need more iterations than others. \n   \n Instead of outdated CPU rendering, CONTEXT may just be one of the first GPU based rendering firms, focusing on  architecture. This  means  faster results  and  more  room  for  adjustments. \n \nInstead of CUDA GPU rendering, CONTEXT uses state of the art RTX technology. Meaning  we  are  on the verge of full real-time rendering.     \n  \nInstead of generic sRGB color space, CONTEXT uses ACEScg, developed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Resulting in a wider and more realistic color spectrum. \n  \nCONTEXT develops all models using Autocad, 3dsmax, and renders in Vray. This so we can import close to every format used by todays architecture firms. ",
